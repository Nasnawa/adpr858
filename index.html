    <h2> Biography </h2>
          <p> When the Taliban entered Afghanistan back in 1996, Nasrin Nawa's family left their home and raised her in Iran for her protection. Eventually she moved back to her country, where she went to college and worked as a journalist in Kabul.

Now this time, Nawa is safe in Lincoln, but her family is stuck in Kabul unable to get out.

      We have never thought, never imagined the Taliban will come to Kabul very quickly and very easily," she said.

The peaceful park near her new apartment in Lincoln is a stark contrast from what she left behind in Kabul just four days ago.
