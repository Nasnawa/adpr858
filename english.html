    <h3 class="card-title">Democracy Now Interview</h3>
    <p class="card-text"> Protests have broken out against the Taliban in Kabul and other cities across Afghanistan as the militant group, at war for 20 years, now finds itself in power. Evacuation flights are continuing from Kabul, but the Taliban is preventing many Afghans from reaching the airport, with some being shot or whipped as they attempt to flee the country amid fears that the Taliban will impose draconian restrictions on everyday life as they did during their last time in power. Women especially are terrified of the future, says journalist Nasrin Nawa, who fled the capital Friday and whose sister is still in the country. “They are totally hopeless and stuck at their houses,” Nawa says.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">CBS News Interview</h3>
    <p class="card-text"> Thousands of Afghans are still struggling to find a way to escape the country as the Taliban take control. Nasrin Nawa, a Fulbright Scholar and former journalist, made it out of Afghanistan days before the government's collapse, but her family members didn't. She joined CBSN to discuss what it's like for her family now, as well as her hopes for the future.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">MSNBC NewsInterview</h3>
    <p class="card-text"> The Taliban today are telling Afghans that there is nothing to fear now that the country is back firmly under their control. But thousands of Afghans aren't waiting to see if that's true, as the Taliban's history of human rights abuses and their disastrous record with women and girls triggers old, but very real, fears. Joining Geoff Bennett to discuss is Photojournalist and author Lynsey Addario, who for two decades covered women in the country, and former BBC Persian Journalist Nasrin Nawa, whose sister is still in Afghanistan. </p>
